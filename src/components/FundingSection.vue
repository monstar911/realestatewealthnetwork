            Imagine having access to $1,000,000 to fund as many deals as you
            desire, all without having to pay any fees or interest. And there's
            no need to worry about qualifying or credit checks eitherâ€“ it's that

          </p>
          <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Our company has already funded over $91,166,873 in deals for our
            members.
